Project Title: Movie Tracker Web Application (Spring Boot Version)
Description:
The Movie Tracker is a modern, full-stack web application built using Spring Boot, designed to help users efficiently manage their movie lists. It allows users to add, update, view, and delete movie entries, while categorizing them as either "Want to Watch" or "Already Watched." The application follows a clean, layered architecture comprising Controller, Service, and Repository layers, and interacts with a PostgreSQL database using Spring Data JPA for seamless ORM-based data access.
The user interface is developed using Thymeleaf, a powerful server-side template engine, which enables dynamic rendering of movie data and user interactions through a responsive and intuitive design. Each movie record includes fields such as title, genre, platform (like Netflix or Prime), and date watched. Users can toggle the watch status, enabling real-time updates to their movie collection.
The project demonstrates key Spring Boot features such as:
Spring MVC for request handling and routing
Spring Data JPA for simplified data persistence
Thymeleaf for dynamic web pages
HikariCP for optimized database connection pooling
Validation annotations for form input handling
Maven for build automation and dependency management
